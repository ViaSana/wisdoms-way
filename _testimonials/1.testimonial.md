I began working with Lisa after my father died.&nbsp; Being well versed in therapy and other forms of understanding, I wanted to explore a Jungian approach to patterns and aspects of myself that had remained in the shadow. In my deeper dives into self, Lisa has been a shining light. Her ability to nurture a kind, inquisitive movement inward has been immensely rewarding and empowering. I have been able to integrate pieces of myself I had protected deep within.&nbsp; I feel more myself! I am more free, able to attend to my needs and receive from others.&nbsp; In addition to Jungian coaching, Lisa holds space for me in many ways, including astrology, tarot, Mindfulness and Compassion classes and yoga. I am profoundly grateful for Lisa's abilities, insights, kindness, and expertise.
