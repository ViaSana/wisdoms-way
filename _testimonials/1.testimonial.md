Working with Lisa and engaging in Jungian coaching has been transformational! I sought out coaching because I was starting my own business and experiencing doubt and fear. Lisa holds a safe space for me to explore deeper shadow aspects of myself, offering tools and ways to shift and integrate these experiences.&nbsp; I have discovered feelings and patterns of thinking and acting that I did not realize were holding me back.&nbsp; Bringing them to light allowed me to move forward. I give Lisa a 10/10 rating and highly recommend her to anyone seeking guidance to understand themselves better, transform old habits/beliefs or just looking for help in becoming a better human.
