I have been studying and working in astrology and tarot for over 20 years and I am happy to give Lisa my strongest endorsement. I feel that Lisa brings a unique combination of intuition, perception, clear communication, counseling knowledge and a warm &nbsp;presence to her work in the metaphysical arena.

I have also benefitted from the clarity, compassion and intuition Lisa brings to Integrative Coaching.&nbsp; I had been feeling stuck and frustrated with some major life decisions.&nbsp; Lisa helped me access feelings and perspective that were outside of my awareness.&nbsp; I was shocked, in a good way! Becoming aware of what was in the unconscious let me shift my perspective and greatly lessened my stress.&nbsp;&nbsp;
