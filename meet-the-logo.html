    title: The  Lotus Flower
    copy: >
      A symbol of truth, Wisdom, transcendence, enlightenment and a metaphor for
      the soul’s journey in both <em>Buddhism and Yoga</em>. The lotus flower
      grows in the mud, through dark and murky waters and thus it is an image of
      beauty that comes though deeper reflection, challenging times, and a
      willingness to bring curiosity, courage and compassionate presence to all
      of life. It is said “no mud, no lotus”.

    title: The Crescent Moon
    copy: >
      Depicted in a number of traditions and meaning making systems, the
      crescent moon is seen as a symbol of <em>possibility, illumination, and
      Wisdom.</em> It is at both the beginning and end of a lunar cycle,
      pointing to the power of aligning with cycles and change as a natural part
      of life. Thus, it can be a time of reflection and gathering what has been
      learned or experienced, releasing what does not need to be carried forward
      (waning crescent) and a time of setting intentions, putting energy toward
      new beginnings, new growth (waxing crescent).

    title: The Unalome
    copy: >
      “As Above, So Below”: This quote speaks to the Wisdom that <em>we are not
      separate from that which is bigger than us, that there is union is what
      appears to be opposites.</em> The story or meaning given to this truth is
      not dictated or offered at Wisdom’s Way—it is the individuals’ path to
      define that if so desired. At Wisdoms’ Way there is the acknowledgment of
      this interconnection and the space to explore how this orientation can
      provide greater connection, meaning, and purpose. In the logo “as above so
      below” is represented in the modernized unalome comprised of dots going
      through the center of the logo from ‘above to below’ culminating in an
      arrow symbolizing a life path. Within the unalome is a star symbolizing
      that our experience can be both influenced by and understood by what
      happens in the heavens and rhythms of nature.

    title: The Elements
    copy: >
      The elements of earth, water, fire, air and space are acknowledged (though
      the names and number may vary) and given qualities in various Wisdom
      traditions including those at Wisdoms’ Way such as <em>yoga, meditation,
      and astrology.</em> A balance of these qualities as well as the knowledge
      of when to utilize the element or its elemental properties to attain
      balance or desired change is a part of living an aligned and empowered
      life. In the logo <em>earth</em> is represented by the lotus,
      <em>water</em> is represented by the crescent moon, <em>fire</em> is
      represented by the star within the unalom, <em>air</em> is represented by
      the arrow shape the unalom makes, and <em>space</em> is represented in the
      container created by crescent moon and the lotus, the womb in which all
      else manifests.
