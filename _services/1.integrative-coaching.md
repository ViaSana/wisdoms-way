  Engage in the transformative journey of Integrative Coaching at Wisdoms’ Way.
  As a certified coach with specialized training in a Jungian approach,
  Integrative Coaching is rooted in the spirit of Anam Cara, or 'soul friend', a
  foundational belief in coming together as equals to hep you connect with your
  innate wisdom and potential. 


  Our coaching relationship provides a sacred space dedicated to exploring what
  truly matters to you and awakening the wisdom that lies within. This immersive
  process utilizes an array of pathways—including meditation, dreamwork, active
  imagination and creatively examining dynamics and patterns at play within the
  psyche and in relationships.  Clients can also chose to incorporate astrology
  with natal, solar return and transit chart readings and the visual oracle of
  the Tarot.

  - question: What is Integrative Coaching?
    answer: >-
      Integrative Coaching is a one-on-one relationship to explore your self’s
      path, address stuckness, mobilize your potential and change patterns
      thought incorporating influences from all sources that inspire Wisdoms’
      Way. Coaching differs from therapy in that is focuses on the present and
      future, possibilities and change, empowerment and fuller vitality where
      the client is known to have the inner resources to integrate the work
      rather than diagnosis and symptom reduction where a therapist is "curing"
      the patient.  Thus, integrative coaching is a shorter term relationship
      that can have cycles as the clients life and path may need. 
  - question: How do I know if this is right for me?
    answer: veniam aute quis consectetur
  - question: What is a Jungian approach in coaching?
    answer: >-
      Carl Jung was an influential psychiatrist who believe the life's work is
      to become who you truly are and from there we experience wellbeing,
      agency, and fulfillment.  Jungian work involved making space for all of
      who we are, the developed self of the ego and the true self, or deeper
      truth of the soul.  Jungian coaching engages the conscious and
      unconscious, the light and shadow, the individual psyche and the insights
      from shared human experience through archetypes and the collective
      unconscious.  "Your vision will become clear only when you can look into
      your own heart. Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes" -
      Carl Jung
  - question: adipisicing laborum consectetur
    answer: non pariatur do cupidatat
