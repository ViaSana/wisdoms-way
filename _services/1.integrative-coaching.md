  Engage in the transformative journey of Integrative Coaching at Wisdoms’ Way.
  As a certified coach with specialized training in a Jungian approach,
  Integrative Coaching is rooted in the spirit of Anam Cara, or 'soul friend', a
  foundational belief in coming together as equals to hep you connect with your
  innate wisdom and potential. 


  Our coaching relationship provides a sacred space dedicated to exploring what
  truly matters to you and awakening the wisdom that lies within. This immersive
  process utilizes an array of pathways—including meditation, dreamwork, active
  imagination and creatively examining dynamics and patterns at play within the
  psyche and in relationships.  Clients can also chose to incorporate astrology
  with natal, solar return and transit chart readings and the visual oracle of
  the Tarot.
