  Engage in the transformative journey of Integrative Coaching at Wisdoms’ Way.
  As a certified coach with specialized training in a Jungian approach,
  Integrative Coaching is rooted in the spirit of Anam Cara, or 'soul friend', a
  foundational belief in coming together as equals to hep you connect with your
  innate Wisdom and potential. 


  The coaching relationship provides a sacred space dedicated to exploring what
  truly matters to you and awakening the Wisdom that lies within. This immersive
  process utilizes an array of pathways—including meditation, dreamwork, active
  imagination and creatively examining dynamics and patterns at play within the
  psyche and in relationships.  Clients can also choose to incorporate astrology
  with natal, solar return and transit chart readings and the visual oracle of
  the tarot.

  - question: What is Integrative Coaching?
    answer: >-

      path, address stuckness, mobilize your potential and change patterns
      thought incorporating influences from all sources that inspire Wisdoms’

  - question: What is a Jungian approach in coaching?
    answer: >-
      Carl Jung was an influential psychiatrist who believed the life's work is
      to become who you truly are and from there we experience wellbeing,
      agency, and fulfillment.  Jungian work involves making space for all of
      who we are; the conditioned self of the ego and the true self, or deeper
      truth of the soul. Jungian coaching engages the conscious and unconscious,
      the light and shadow, the individual psyche and the insights from shared
      human experience through archetypes and the collective unconscious.  "Your
      vision will become clear only when you can look into your own heart. Who
      looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes" - Carl Jung
  - question: How do I know if coaching is right for me?
    answer: >-
      A free consultation call is the first step in exploring coaching.  This
      call will allow us to get to know each other a bit and will involve a
      short intake which let's us look at what is bringing you to coaching. 
      This will let us see if we feel my approach and what is present for you
      are a good fit.
  - question: How is coaching different from therapy?
    answer: >-
      Coaching differs from therapy in that coaching focuses on the present and
      future, possibilities and change, empowerment and fuller vitality where
      the client is known to have the inner resources to integrate the work.  At
      Wisdoms' Way coaching is like having a midwife for the voice of your true
      Self.  In contrast, therapy is a treatment approach that focuses on mental
      health, diagnosis, symptom reduction, and processing the past,  where it
      is the therapist role to help  "cure" the patient.  
  - question: >-
      What if coaching is not a fit for me but I still want to benefit from
      Wisdoms' Way?
    answer: >-
      Integrative coaching is the most individualized and therefore most
      intimate way to work together, thought it is not always the right fit or
      the right time.  In fact, sometimes taking a course is a great way to
      start or even receiving a natal astrology chart.  Taking a course or
      having a chart reading can begin to open up curiosity and a different way
      of seeing and relating to things that may pave a road to coaching or may
      be enough on its own for any given point in one's live.
