  Embrace the transformative journey of integrative soul coaching at Wisdoms’
  Way. As a certified coach with specialized training in a Jungian approach,
  Integrative Coaching is rooted in the spirit of Anam Cara, or 'soul friend', a
  foundational belief in coming together as equals to hep you connect with your
  innate wisdom and potential. 


  Our coaching relationship provides a sacred space dedicated to exploring what
  truly matters to you and awakening the wisdom that lies within. This immersive
  process utilizes an array of pathways—ranging from meditation to working with
  dreams and active imagination to examining dynamics and patterns at play
  within the psyche and in relationships.  Clients can also chose to incorporate
  astrology with chart readings and the visual oracle of the Tarot.
