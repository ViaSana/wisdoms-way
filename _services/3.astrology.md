description: >-
  Astrology at Wisdomsâ€™ Way is a means of connecting and consulting with factors
  beyond the limits of our conventional perceptions. Readings integrate a deep
  understanding of archetypes and the symbolic and energetic essence of
  individual aspects of the reading to provide the client a mirror for
  reflection and creative ways to respond to what is present in one's life. 
  Astrology offers a celestial perspective on our personal tendencies, ways of
  being and relating, and areas of ease and challenge that can give us an
  inspired attitude toward our life and how to navigate life's wonders and
  challenges.  A reading can serve as a celestial compass, guiding us through
  life's journey and offering profound insights into our purpose and potential, 
  further illuminating your pathway to self-discovery.  With this tool, we can
  experience more agency and develop a more compassionate relationship with all
  aspects of ourselves.

faqs:
  - question: What if I do not know anything about Astrology?
    answer: >-
      Knowledge of astrology is not necessary for a reading.  My approach to
      readings includes providing education about the system and allows the
      space for questions and clarification as fits the client's preferences.
  - question: Do I have to "believe" in Astrology?
    answer: >-
      Astrology is an offering at Wisdoms' Way and clients do not have to choose
      to experience a reading.   While some may see this tool as prophetic or
      deterministic,  my approach to this metaphysical pathway is to consult
      with it as a tool, lens of understanding, way to open up awareness and
      expand perspectives. I believe strongly that our lives are a co-creation
      of factors within and outside of our control. The more we understand and
      the clearer we see, the more empowered we are to make informed choices and
      take skillful action.  
  - question: How would I refer a client for a reading?
    answer: >-
      The first step is to assess if your client is interested and open to a
      reading to ensure it is their choice. Your client then would reach out for
      a free consultation call.  The reading and its finding would be the
      property of the client to share as they see fit or not.
