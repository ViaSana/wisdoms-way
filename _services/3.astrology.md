description: >-
  Astrology & Tarot at Wisdomsâ€™ Way is a means of connecting and consulting with
  factors beyond the limits of our conventional perceptions. Readings integrate
  a deep understanding of archetypes and the symbolic and energetic essence of
  individual aspects of the reading to provide the client a mirror for
  reflection and creative ways to respond to what is present in one's life. 
  Astrology offers a celestial perspective on our personal tendencies, ways of
  being and relating, and areas of ease and challenge that can give us an
  inspired attitude toward our life and how to navigate life's wonders and
  challenges.  A reading can serve as a celestial compass, guiding us through
  life's journey and offering profound insights into our purpose and potential, 
  further illuminating your pathway to self-discovery.  With this tool, we can
  experience more agency and develop a more compassionate relationship with all
  aspects of ourselves.  The tarot is a visual oracle to open up perception and
  possibility, invite creative and flexible ways of seeing things, and remind us
  of inner resources and potential we may have forgotten.

faqs:
  - question: What if I do not know anything about Astrology or Tarot?
    answer: >-
      Knowledge of astrology and tarot is not necessary for a reading.  My
      approach to readings includes providing education about these modalities
      and allows the space for questions and clarification as fits the client's
      preferences.
  - question: Do I have to "believe" in Astrology and/or Tarot?
    answer: >-
      Astrology and tarot are offerings at Wisdoms' Way and clients do not have
      to choose to experience a reading.   While some may see these tools as
      prophetic or deterministic,  my approach to these metaphysical pathways is
      to consult with them as tools, lens' of understanding, ways to open up
      awareness and expand perspectives. I believe strongly that our lives are a
      co-creation of factors within and outside of our control. The more we
      understand and the clearer we see, the more empowered we are to make
      informed choices and take skillful action.  
  - question: How would I refer a client for a reading?
    answer: >-
      The first step is to assess if your client is interested and open to a
      reading to ensure it is their choice. Your client then would reach out for
      a free consultation call.  The reading and its finding would be the
      property of the client to share as they see fit or not.
