faqs:
  - question: Where are courses and workshops held?
    answer: Wisdoms' Way courses and workshops are held on-line on Zoom.
  - question: Can I take a course or workshop from anywhere?
    answer: >-
      Yes, because courses and workshops are virtual they can be taken
      anywhere.  It is important, however, that the space you are in given a
      sense of being sacred, limiting distraction and allowing you to be fully
      present for yourself and the experience.  This will support learning from
      a place of presence and with your full being.  Often we multi-task and
      divide attention.  This might allow us to take in understanding at the
      level of the thinking mind, but not necessarily allow us to learn fully -
      body, heart, mind and spirit. 
  - question: How are personalized courses or workshops delivered?
    answer: >-
      Personalized courses and workshops can be offered live or recorded to meet
      the needs of the group or organization.
